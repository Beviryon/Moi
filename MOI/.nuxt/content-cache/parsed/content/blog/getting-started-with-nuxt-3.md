# Getting Started with Nuxt 3: A Complete Guide

Nuxt 3 is the latest version of the popular Vue.js framework that makes building modern web applications a breeze. With its powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and automatic code splitting, Nuxt 3 is the perfect choice for developers who want to create fast, SEO-friendly applications.

## What is Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework built on top of Vue.js that provides:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and initial page load performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-rendered pages for maximum performance
- **Auto-imports** - No need to manually import components and composables
- **File-based routing** - Automatic routing based on your file structure
- **TypeScript support** - Built-in TypeScript support out of the box

## Installation

Getting started with Nuxt 3 is simple. You can create a new project using the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

A typical Nuxt 3 project has the following structure:

```
my-nuxt-app/
├── assets/          # Uncompiled assets (SCSS, images, etc.)
├── components/      # Vue components
├── composables/     # Vue composables
├── layouts/         # Layout components
├── middleware/      # Route middleware
├── pages/           # File-based routing
├── plugins/         # Plugins
├── public/          # Static assets
├── server/          # Server-side code
└── nuxt.config.ts   # Nuxt configuration
```

## Key Features

### 1. Auto-imports

Nuxt 3 automatically imports components, composables, and utilities, so you don't need to manually import them:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- No need to import MyComponent -->
    <MyComponent />
  </div>
</template>

<script setup>
// No need to import useHead
useHead({
  title: 'My Page'
})
</script>
```

### 2. File-based Routing

Create routes by simply adding files to the `pages` directory:

```
pages/
├── index.vue        # /
├── about.vue        # /about
├── blog/
│   ├── index.vue    # /blog
│   └── [slug].vue   # /blog/:slug
```

### 3. Server-side Rendering

Nuxt 3 provides excellent SSR capabilities out of the box:

```vue
<script setup>
// This will be executed on the server
const { data } = await $fetch('/api/posts')
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Posts</h1>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="post in data" :key="post.id">
        {{ post.title }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript** - Enable TypeScript for better development experience
2. **Optimize Images** - Use the built-in image optimization features
3. **Leverage Composables** - Create reusable logic with composables
4. **Use Server Routes** - Build API routes directly in your Nuxt app
5. **Enable Auto-imports** - Take advantage of the auto-import feature

## Conclusion

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework that makes building modern web applications easier and more enjoyable. With its excellent developer experience, performance optimizations, and rich ecosystem, it's the perfect choice for your next project.
